# Markdown Schedule

With Markdown Schedule, you can more easily view tasks set throughout all of your Markdown files created from apps like Obsidian, and get reminded when the time is right!

Now available for Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stillloading.mdschedule

## Features
- Daily calendar-like view
- Notifications
- Home Screen Widget

## Use:
- Compatible with the [Obsidian Tasks plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) with the emoji format:
  - Start date: 🛫 2024-12-31
  - Scheduled date: ⏳ 2024-12-31 (If not set it will be taken as the file name if applicable)
  - Due date: 📅 2024-12-31
  - Priority (from highest to lowest): 🔺, ⏫, 🔼, (No priority = normal), 🔽, ⏬
  - Status(character inside checkbox): To do [ ], Done [x], Cancelled [-], In Progress [/]
  - Optional tag to differentiate tasks that you want the program to recognize e.g. #task or #todo
- Easy and readable way to set an event (task with a set time). If enabled, a notification will be delivered on the start time of the event. Any of these is valid:
  - @ 9:00
  - @ 09:30 - 12:00
  - @ 2024-12-31 8:45 - 09:00
  - For those without a date, it will use one of start date > due date > scheduled date.
- Task example:

  \- [ ] #todo This is a task with medium importance that is still not done and I will be notified on August 30th at 4:00 pm @16:00 🔼 🛫 2024-08-30 📅 2024-09-05
- Additional support for 'static tasks', which need to be in a file with today's date as the title. Compatible with the [Obsidian Day Planner plugin](https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner):

  \-  08:00 - 09:00 Wake up
- All dates must follow the YYYY-MM-DD format.
