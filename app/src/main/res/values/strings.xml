    <string name="useExplanation1">
        1. Using an external software for creating and editing Markdown files (.md),
        you can set tasks and events by using the following syntax:\n\n
        - All tasks and events must be in a line that starts with a Markdown checkbox \'\- [ ]\' \n
        - Start date: üõ´ 2024\-12\-31\n
        - Scheduled date: ‚è≥ 2024\-12\-31 (If not set it will be taken as the file name if applicable)\n
        - Due date: üìÖ 2024\-12\-31\n
        - Priority (from highest to lowest): üî∫, ‚è´, üîº, (No priority = normal), üîΩ, ‚è¨\n
        - Status(character inside checkbox): To do [ ], Done [x], Cancelled [\-], In Progress [\/]\n
        - Optional tag to differentiate tasks that you want the program to recognize e.g. \#task or \#todo\n
        - Set an event:\n
        \@ 9:00\n
        \@ 09:30 \- 12:00\n
        \@ 2024\-12\-31 8:45 \- 09:00\n
        For those without a date, it will use one of start date, due date, or scheduled date (the priority is in that order).\n
        If enabled, a notification will be delivered on the start time of the event. Any of these is valid:\n
        - Set a static event (not compatible with the syntax specified above),
        which needs to be located inside a file with today\'s date as the title e.g. 2024\-12\-31.md:\n
        These may be inside a checkbox (\- [ ]) or a normal bullet point (\-).\n
        08:00 \- 09:00 Wake up\n\n
        Example Markdown file with the title \'2024\-09\-02\':

    <string name="useExplanation2">
        2. Save the Markdown file inside a folder in the phone\'s external storage e.g. Documents\n\n
        3. Specify the folder in Settings \> Folder Paths. You can also change any of the settings according to your preferences.\n\n
        4. Return to the main page and press the refresh button at the top of the screen.\n\n
        5. Wait for the loading wheel to stop. If you leave the application early, it may not update correctly.\n\n
